# Cinematic - The World Builders System
## Introduction 
What is Cinematic? Cinematic is a gaming system designed from the ground up to support game masters who like to design their own custom worlds. When I started Game Mastering my own games, I quickly discovered that a lot of the pleasure in running a game for me came from the ability to redefine reality as I saw fit, and create totally unique experiences. This approach to gaming is a lot of work, but it pays off in the immersive gaming experience I was able to provide my players. I went through many systems during my first couple of years in roleplaying. Most of them were good at what they did. They provided a framework for playing a specific type of game, within a few predefined parameters, and gave a smooth, consistent, and enjoyable experience to the players. Most players pretty much know what to expect when someone offers to run a game in X system, because the system offers a consistent experience. While these are all positive attributes for a system in most circumstances, in the case of a game master who wants a completely custom tailored experience, this can cause a lot of confusion and player frustration. This system aims to alleviate that by providing only core mechanics to support custom magic systems, weapons, armour, etc. within a predicable algorithm to ensure that your combats remain balanced and difficulty in tasks is predictable.

### What sorts of games can I run? 
With a bit of work you should be able to run games in any genera including fantasy, science fiction, western, modern fantasy, paranormal, and horror. I play-tested this version of it using a fantasy game, but the concepts are universal, and I have played enough science fiction games to keep them in mind. Running any game in Cinematic will take more work than it will in another, more defined, system. Other systems make many assumptions about your game, your players, and the type of interactions you will be having with your players. These assumptions are fine until they are not true. I have tried to make very few assumptions in the design of this system, which means that you will have to define certain elements of gameplay for yourself. You will have to define things like:
1. How magic works (or is there magic), and the spells characters can use 
2. What types of equipment are available
3. What types of characters the players are allowed to play 
4. What races and professions can characters play, and what are their special abilities 
5. Much, much more... 

The advantage of doing this extra work is that you will be able to present a completely custom game to your players! The downside of this is that your player cannot tell you he wants to play a 6" level elven ranger, build a character sheet on his own in an hour, and be ready to play. You will have to define what being an elf even means and character design will go from there. 1 ule elves in your game are technomancers who have merged with a sentient quantum computer Trom an alien planet, you will be glad you had this flexibility.

### Does Cinematic do X? 
This is a common question for players new to a system. The answer for most versions of this question is going to depend on the game master. Cinematic does just about anything – provided your game master has decided to support it in his/her game. Support for very few things are inherent in Cinematic, but almost nothing is unsupported either. The question you should be asking is, “What is possible in this game world?” which is a question that the game master is uniquely qualified to answer.

### What do I need to play Cinematic? 
Cinematic is very low investment! To play you will need:
1. This core rulebook
2. 6 - six sided dice
3. A character sheet
4. A pencil 

Cinematic is designed to be played by 3-8 players, with a game master acting as referee and god in general. Do not forget your imagination!

## Roleplaying

### Why do people role-play? 
There are many different reasons that people are attracted to roleplaying. Some people are attracted to pretending to be someone else. Others enjoy escaping from reality and entering into a world where the good people really do win. Still others enjoy getting to live out fantasies that are impossible (or too scary!) to live out in real life. If you are a game master, you may have a passion for telling stories and enjoy the instant gratification that GM's have when telling these stories interactively. These are all equally legitimate reasons to roleplay, and they only scratch the surface of the reasons people have. 

### How do I roleplay? 
There is no one correct answer to this question, except that no matter how you do it, it should be fun! Most roleplaying does have certain elements in common though. Usually, roleplaying will involve pretending to be someone else', or at the very least, you will pretend to be somewhere else.

### Playing the game 
Try to lose yourself to the game. Listen carefully to the descriptions the game master gives you of the imaginary world around you, and think carefully of the way your character would react to these things if they were a real person. There is no “right" or "wrong" thing for your character to do; only the thing they would actually do. Your goal as a player is to stay true to the motivations of this imagined character, and to be a part in shaping his/her future.<br/>
You will be responsible for representing your character to the game master and to the other players. You tell the game master the things your character does, what he says, what he likes and dislikes, etc. Typically, this is done in real-time, in response to the stimulus provided by the game master.

For example, the game master may describe a room in a tavern to you:<br/>
<center><em>"You enter a dark back room in the seedy tavern in town. You can smell the stale ale that has soaked the floors many times over the years. In the center of the room is a round table, surrounded by four wooden benches. A single oil lantern dimly illuminates the room, casting furtive shadows on the walls. What do you do?"</em></center>
<br/>
Your responses to this information can vary according to what your character would do. It could be anything from “I check the room to make sure nobody is hiding in the shadows!” if you feel that your character might be frightened, to “I sit on a stool and order a big mug of cold ale, 11 your character is used to seedy taverns and dark back rooms. It is up to you to decide. 

### Dialog 
Part of roleplaying in a tabletop game is engaging in dialog with the other players in the game “in character.” Speaking in character means that you are playing the voice of your character the same way that an actor plays the voice of an imagined character in a movie or television show. Speaking in someone else's voice may seem awkward at first, but it will become more natural the longer you do it.
<br/>
Some players find it enjoyable to give their character a unique accent, or a catch phrase that they repeat on a regular basis. A character that has a strong peasant's accent and exclaims, “By Tyr's Beard!” is much more interesting in certain situations than the person who sounds just like you and says, “Holy shit!” Depending on the genera of the game, the period you are playing in, and the composition of the group, either option may be appropriate. If you are in doubt, have a conversation with your game master. He or she will be able to give you invaluable information about what style of speech will be most enjoyable in their game world.
<br/>
Before long, you will be having hour-long conversations with other people that do not exist, and it will seem the most natural thing in the world. Whether this makes you a touch crazy or not, we leave for you to decide for yourself.
<br/>
One note of caution: it is important to ensure that the players all know for sure when you are speaking in character and when you are speaking as yourself. A comment that your character would make to another character might be offensive to the player if you say it to themselves. One group I was a part of would hold their hands in the shape of a capital T, similar to a coach calling "time out” when they intended to speak out of character. The rest of the time, we assumed them to be speaking as their character. 
<br/>
For example, dialog at the gaming table may go something like this:
<center><em>Paige (EID): "I walk into the room and take a seat at the table. I call out, I
know you're in here... you might as well come out.'<br/>
Darin (Halfling): “I slip out of the shadows and step into the candlelight. 'You are late to the meeting elf. I do not tolerate being kept waiting.'"<br/>
Darin looks at the GM. "I am going to throw my dagger at Paige.”<br/>
GM: "Ok. I need both of you to roll Initiative.”<br/>
<br/>
The players both roll, and Darin wins.<br/>
GM: “Paige, you see a dagger glint as Darin reaches into his sleeve, and a moment later the hilt is sticking out of your chest! You feel a burning sensation spreading throughout your body. What do you do?” </br>
Paige: “You fiend! You will never find the jewels now. The secret will go with
w me to my grave!'GM, I am going to flee the room!”</em></center>
<br/>

## What is “Gamer's Etiquette?” 
Any group activity will require the members thereof to agree to abide by a certain set of social rules in order to ensure that everyone gets along in the end. Gaming is no different from anything else in this regard, and you should take care to ensure that players interact with one another with adequate respect and courtesy. <br/>
Over time, you will find that you have to extend normal social courtesies to cover situations that do not normally pop up in the real world. No one list of rules will apply equally to every group and every game, however the ones listed here may be useful as a starting guide for your group. <br/>

### Example Game Table Guidelines
1. Talking at the table should be in character, to another player and related to current game events, or directly to the DM. You should not be cracking jokes,' talking to people not involved in the game, or carrying on non-game conversations with other players. This is highly distracting and makes it difficult for other players to hear. 
2. Do not criticize the actions of another player. If you believe that someone is doing something stupid, chances are you should keep that opinion to yourself. There are respectful ways of questioning a character's action in character. If you cannot be respectful, or your character would not try to advise the other character, be quiet. 
3. It is always a good idea to ask the DM if it is an appropriate time to leave the table when you need to step away. This helps avoid table hang-ups when a character is suddenly absent at inopportune times. 
4. Do not correct the DM unless your correction will benefit the player. Do not mention judgement errors that do not affect the outcome, or that are in the player's benefit. Some mistakes may even be intentional: the DM reserves the right to make world specific adjustments.
5. Try to have your action ready by the time the DM gets to your turn in combat. This helps keep things moving and keeps people from getting bored. Try to have any applicable rules text ready if your action uses a new ability or is mechanically complicated. 
6. Remember why we are here. Nobody comes to the gaming table to be miserable. They come to have fun. Nothing at the table is important enough to get upset or argue over. As soon as we start doing that, we have missed the whole point of coming to the table. 
7. Do not interrupt another player's interaction with the DM. Raise your hand and wait for acknowledgement from the DM. He will get to you in turn. Players wait patiently for their turn with the DM, and it is rude to steal that time away from them. 
8. Try to work together. It can be tempting to play a character that does not get along with others. These “lone wolf” type characters are often the hero of our favorite books, and we want to have the opportunity to play characters with similar traits. This can become a real problem in games however, as your caustic personality causes rifts in the game and arguments erupt. Playing a character that is socially awkward or who is standoffish is fine, but playing one who is uncooperative or who disrupts every well-intentioned plan the party has is not. The DM will not defend your character's right to be disruptive. 
9. Play your character, not theirs. Do not under any circumstances tell another player what he should do with his character, or tell the DM what another player's character does. This is not your place.

## Designing a Character
Designing a character can be a very exciting process! It is a new beginning, which only comes once in most games. The paradigm in Cinematic is to design the "who" of your character first, then to make sure that the mechanical design of your character reflects this concept.

### Concepting a character 
Game masters all have different methods for helping players generate characters, and many experienced players have already established habits for how they approach coming up with a character idea. Here, I present an approach, which seems to work well with Cinematic. Since this system is rather different from many standard ones, I recommend at least trying this one before deciding not to use it. You may find at least some of its concepts useful.
#### Goals and Motivations 
First, consider what your character's goals are. You need to spend as much time as is necessary to have a good idea of your characters goals and motivations. These things move your character forward, and make life worth living for him. Why does he get out of bed in the morning? What are his goals? Where does he see his life going, and how does he want to get there?
#### Abilities 
Next, ask yourself what your character is good at doing. What are his talents, abilities, and skills that set him apart from the average crowd? Every character should have at least one ability that makes him stand out. (Even if not being noticed is your skill!) Try not to think in mechanical terms during this portion of the character generation. Think in real world terms.<br/>
Now, think of things that your character is horrible at doing. It may not seem obvious to new roleplayers, but the things we are bad at define us just as much as the things we are good at doing! Failure, while not our favorite thing, is an essential part of success. The wizard with phenomenal cosmic power who cannot tie his own shoes is much more interesting than the person who can do everything, all the time.

#### Backstory 
If you have time, you may also want to write out a backstory explaining where your character came from. Some game masters may even require this step, because it will add a great deal of depth to your character. Make sure you have the game master's assistance with this step, should you chose to take it. You will want to ensure that nothing you place in your backstory will conflict with world-specific timelines and items. Having a clear idea of where your character came from can give you a better idea of where he is going, not to mention having stories to tell around the proverbial camp fire in game.

## The Mechanics 
### Character Points 
Character points are what you spend to buy attributes, talents, and abilities for your character. The number of them that you have invested into the mechanics of your character can be considered a measure of how powerful they are.<br/>
Your Game Master will give you a certain amount of character points when you begin designing your character sheet. These points are for initial character design, and should all be spent during the creation step. You may not be allowed to keep them after the initial setup of your character.<br/>
You may also receive character points during the course of the game (or not, depending on your GM) with which to power up your character. Think of spending points mid-game as reflecting the skills and experience you have acquired over time. 

### Ability Scores 
Cinematic uses a system of six ability scores to represent your raw physical attributes. We call these Ability Scores. You use your ability scores to determine a secondary number called an Ability Modifier, which determines bonuses or penalties to certain skills and talents. An ability score of seven means you are an average hero (3 being an average human). Typical Cinematic characters start the game with a seven in every ability score for free. This may be modified by your GM in some campaigns. Improvements in ability scores can be purchased with character points. In certain campaigns you may also be able to gain extra character points by taking a below average ability score. You should ask your GM if this option is available for you. <br/>
<br/>
| Ability Score | Ability Modifier |
| :------------ | ---------------: |
| 0             |               -3 |
| 1-2           |               -2 |
| 3-5           |               -1 |
| 6-8           |                0 |
| 9-11          |               +1 |
| 12-14         |               +2 |
| 15            |               +3 |

Ability score points are worth 5 character points each. No character can have an ability score lower than 2, unless you are playing a non-humanoid creature and the GM has given you their express blessing. Be sure you know what you are doing though, because you may be crippled in many circumstances!<br/>

#### Strength 
Strength is a measurement of your raw physical power: your ability to move weight, exert pressure, hit things hard, open things, etc. You add your strength modifier to damage for melee attacks, and the game master may determine what types of weapons you are eligible to wield based upon this number. Fighter types, laborers, and artisans should invest in this attribute. 

#### Dexterity 
Dexterity is a measure of how adept you are at moving your body in precise ways: shooting a ranged weapon, balancing on a tightrope, doing gymnastics and certain martial arts. Performers, archers, riflemen, and various other high dexterity professions should invest in this attribute.

#### Health 
Health is the measure of how much punishment your body can take before breaking down. This ability determines your Hit Points, and abilities like Endurance or resisting a disease. Characters who will sustain injuries on a regular basis, or are exposed to severe climate or disease will benefit from investing in this ability. 

#### Intelligence 
Intelligence measures how smart you are. By default, this does not reflect knowledge. Skills represent actual knowledge or training in a subject or task. Intelligence does reflect how quickly you can acquire new skills, figure something out that you have never encountered before, and gives bonuses to skills having to do with mental ability. This score determines magical ability, and you add your Intelligence modifier to your spell damage. 

#### Perception 
Someone with a high perception score notices things more quickly than someone with a low perception score does. It effects your abilities to track an animal through the woods, hear a whispered conversation, or notice a subtle gesture.

#### Charisma 
Charisma is a measure of several things and is open to a lot of interpretation on the part of the game master. A high charisma can indicate someone who is better looking than average, better spoken and generally more charming than average, or even a better lover. Most game masters will base abilities to convince other characters and NPCs (Non-Player Characters) to do what you want them to do, or to believe a lie. You should ask your game master what they plan to base on this ability.

### Derived Stats

#### Hit Points 
Hit points are a measurement of how much damage your character's body can handle before slipping into unconsciousness. Your hit points are equal to your Health score multiplied by 4 (e.g. a character with a health score of 7 has 28 hit points). Hit points are abbreviated as HP on most character sheets.

#### Move Speed 
The typical, human sized creature has a move speed of 30 feet per round. This can be modified by certain circumstances, such as being a different size, having more than 2 legs, magic, etc. The Game Master will inform you if special rules apply to your character. 

### Talents 
A talent is a special ability that you cannot acquire by sheer effort. It is an innate ability – it sets you apart from the rest of the normal world. <br/>

You purchase talents in levels, a concept which will appear several times in the mechanics of this system. Typical skills cost six character points per level, but these may be adjusted by your GM depending on the rarity of the ability in their campaign. Depending on what level you choose to purchase, talents bestow certain abilities.<br/>

For instance, if you are designing a powerful wizard, you might choose to purchase Arcana Level 5, for 15 character points. In this case, Arcana 5 grants you the ability to cast fifth level spells, and determines the number of mana points you have to power those spells. You will have to ask your game master for a list of talents (if any) that are available in their game.

#### Example Talents 
| Talent Name                        |      Cost |
| :--------------------------------- | --------: |
| Arcana (Magic)                     | 6 pts/lvl |
| Lightning Reflexes (+1 initiative) | 5 pts/lvl |

### Skills 
Skills are the bread and butter of character action and interaction. Almost all of the things your character will do on a day-to-day basis will be based on skill rolls. Skills represent anything you can learn how to do if offered the appropriate training and opportunities. <br/>
Skills are represented mechanically by a number of character points converted into a Die Modifier (DM) based on the chart below. Skills are sorted by their difficulty, which represents how strenuous the skill is and how difficult it is to learn it. A skill that most people can perform or learn is considered an Easy skill. Something that only an expert in a field could perform would be a Hard skill. Only the very best in any area dare to perform Very Hard skills on a regular basis.

#### Skill Checks 
A skill check is made to determine if you succeed or fail at a skill attempt. To make a skill check, you roll 2d6, and add the total to the DMs that apply to the skill. The total is your roll. When you add the numbers up, you tell the game master “I rolled an X” (X is the number you rolled.)<br/>
<br/>
Skill levels vary between zero and four. A skill of zero means that you have baseline training in a skill. If you do not have a DM of at least zero in a skill, you are said to be defaulting the roll and suffer a -3 DM to your roll. A skill DM of 2 means that you are a professional, 3 that you are a master in your field, and 4 represents someone who would be considered a paragon - a once in a lifetime paradigm changer - who others will attempt to emulate for years.
Skill Costs (in points, from untrained) 
| DM   | Easy  | Normal | Hard  | Very Hard |
| :--- | :---: | :----: | :---: | :-------: |
| 0    |   1   |   2    |   3   |     4     |
| +1   |   2   |   4    |   6   |     8     |
| +2   |   3   |   6    |   9   |    12     |
| +3   |   4   |   8    |  12   |    16     |
| +4   |   5   |   10   |  15   |    20     |

You may not have a skill level above four unless the game master applies some very special exceptions to your character. You will have to work directly with the game master to design such a character.<br/>
<br/>
Skills are also based on an attribute, which means that when you roll a skill check you will add the skill DM, the ability modifier for the ability the skill is based on, and the die roll.<br/>
The game master compares the number the player made on a roll to a Difficulty Check (DC). If the roll is above the DC, the player succeeds. If it is lower, the player fails – so a high skill die modifier increases your odds of succeeding at a task. 

#### Initiative
case Initiative determines what order characters get to take their actions in during combat. Your initiative modifier is equal to your dexterity modifier, with any bonuses from talents added in. This number is a DM that is applied during the initiative check at the beginning of combat. 

#### Dodge 
Dodging is an option that players can use to avoid getting hit in combat, at a cost. Most characters start out with a dodge modifier of zero. Talents may raise this to a higher number. 

#### Damage Reduction (DR) 
Damage reduction is a modifier applied to your character by the armour (or magical protections) they are wearing, and is applied to damage dealt to your character. Any time damage would be calculated against your character, reduce that number by the amount of damage reduction you have for that body zone. A character wearing no armour and possessing no magical protection has a DR of zero.

## Playing The Game
So, you have learned the terminology of roleplaying and you have sat down and hammered your way through creating a kick-ass character to play. Now what? In this chapter I will explain some of the final things you need to know in order to actually begin playing the game with a Game Master. If you are going to be the Game Master yourself, you have a bit more work to do after this, but you still need this chapter.<br/>
<br/>
### What do I do with all these dice? 
Well... you roll them. No, wait.... Don't slap me in the head just yet. It really is that simple. Just about every significant thing you do in the game will require you to roll some dice to determine the outcome.<br/>
<br/>
Every time you roll the dice, we call that a check. There are several types of checks that you may be asked to make by the GM, but they all work in the same basic way: you will roll a certain number of six-sided die, and add up the result.<br/>
<br/>
In Cinematic, a higher roll is always better. Higher rolls reflect more skill, more finesse, and more damage done to your foe. The number that you roll on the dice, before you add anything to it, is called the natural roll. For instance, if you roll a four and a five, you might say that you rolled a "natural nine."<br/>
<br/>
Most checks have something called a die modifier, which is a bonus or penalty to your roll. This number is combined with your natural roll to produce your check. If the Game Master asks me to make a climbing skill check, I will roll 2d6 (read two-die-six, meaning two six sided die) and see what my natural roll (in this case a two and a five) was. I will then add the DM of my climbing skill (in this case +2). My skill check was a nine, which is what I tell the Game Master. If the climb was a normal difficulty, an eight or higher succeeds, which means I succeeded by one. The amount I succeeded by will be a concept that becomes important later on.

### Rounds
TODO

### Combat 
Combat is the heart and soul of many table based games. Pitting your skill and combat prowess against the enemy, claiming victory for your group. Cinematic supports combat using a combination of tried and true techniques.

#### The Combat Round 
Combat is described in Cinematic as taking place in rounds. Each round describes what the players and opponents are doing for a six-second period. The actions are said to take place simultaneously, however since it is impossible for all the players to state their actions at the same time, the round is broken up into turns. The order of turns is determined by something called an initiative check that will be explained later in this section. <br/>
<br/>
Each turn consists of:
- 1 Significant Action 
- 1 Insignificant Action 
- 1 Move Action 
- Several Free Actions

You do not have to take the actions in any specific order, nor do you have to use each action every turn. Unused turns do not roll over to the next turn; they are lost at the end of your turn.<br/>
<br/>
A Significant action may be used as an additional move action. Move actions however, may not be used as additional significant actions.

#### Significant Actions 
A significant action is described as any primary action, or any undefined action that would take a significant portion of your six-second turn.<br/>
<br/>
Examples of significant actions are attacks, some skill checks, casting a spell, etc. In general, if it would cause damage, you can safely assume it is a significant action unless you have a good reason to think otherwise (like the rule text of a special spell).

#### Insignificant Actions 
Actions that prepare you to take a significant action, or undefined actions that would not take a significant portion of a six-second turn are defined as insignificant actions. <br/>
<br/>
Picking something up inside your own space, or drawing a bow or gun would be defined as an insignificant action. There are also cases where a special weapon or spell will allow you to take an extra, less powerful attack on as an insignificant action.

#### Move Actions 
Move actions are any type of movement that would either move you in a direction, or take any measurable amount of time to accomplish. <br/>
<br/>
Standing up from prone is a move action. Moving in any direction up to your move speed is a move action. Driving a car in any direction up to its move speed is a move action. Any undefined movement that the game master determines to be significant can also be a move action. 

#### Free Actions 
Talking to other characters, dropping something on the ground in your own space, certain spells, and numerous other things that take no time and require no concentration are free actions. The game master is the final arbiter of both what is a free action, and how many free actions a player may have per round.<br/>
<br/>
The game master may have to limit free actions if they begin to be abused by some players. While long conversations during game may be normal most of the time, during a six second combat round limitless conversation may detract from the energy of the game. In this situation, the game master may limit the amount of conversation allowed per round to keep the energy moving. You may also be limited from performing a long chain of free actions that would actually require concentration to perform in six short seconds. Remember, the GM is the final arbiter of how many free actions you can take – so ask if you are not sure.

### Initiative Checks 
The order that turns are taken in combat is determined by the Initiative Order. At the beginning of combat, the game master will instruct the players involved to make an Initiative Check, which means to roll 2d6 and add their Initiative Modifier on their character sheet. This value is equal to the characters dexterity modifier plus any bonuses from talents, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The game master will also make initiative checks for the opponents and note them on a separate sheet of paper. The involved parties then begin taking their turns in order, starting with the highest initiative check, in descending order.

#### Surprise Rounds 
In certain circumstances, certain parties will not be aware of opponents when combat begins. In this case, the parties that are aware will get to take part in an extra round, where the aware parties take a turn in initiative order, skipping the parties that are unaware. After the surprise round, all parties are assumed aware, unless the attack is made in stealth (see Using Stealth).

### Attacking an opponent 
Attacking your opponent is done the same way you make a skill check. You roll your weapon skill against a DC known by the game master to hit your opponent.<br/>
<br/>
Whether this DC is known to the player is up to the game master. Some game masters prefer the DC to be secret, while others prefer the players being fully informed about the factors affecting their roll. Cinematic does not take sides in this debate.<br/>
<br/>
If the player succeeds their attack roll, the target of the attack may attempt to dodge if they are aware of their attacker (see Surprise Rounds). 

#### Critical Hits and Misses 
Sometimes both the wonderful and the horrible happen in real life. These are the moments that define us as people, and are almost always the most memorable. Cinematic represents these moments as critical hits and critical misses. <br/>
<br/>
You have scored a critical hit when you roll a natural 12 on 2d6. This means that you have achieved the peak of your potential and luck has smiled on you during your attempt. The on a critical hit you will deal extra damage determined by what type of weapon you are using. If you are unarmed, you deal +1 HP of damage on a critical hit. <br/>
<br/>
Critical misses are when you roll a natural 2 on 2d6 - also known as snake eyes. Disaster strikes when you see snake eyes! Rolling a critical miss is always a miss, even if your total with modifiers would have succeeded. Additionally, the Game Master may decide that your misfortune extends even further, and you could fall victim to a tragic circumstance! Dropping your weapon, falling flat on your face, and even taking a small amount of damage from a misstep are all within the realm of possibility.

#### Using stealth 
You may use stealth to surprise your opponent. If the opponent is not already aware of you, make an opposed check of the stealth skill against your opponent's awareness skill. (These skills may vary depending on the GM's skill setup.) If your stealth check exceeds your opponent's awareness check, they are considered surprised if attacked during that round. Your opponent may make another awareness check each round that you attempt to elude them.

#### Defending yourself 
You are not helpless when attacked: you may dodge the attack. If you are taking too much damage from a fight, you may also attempt to run away, and elude chasers using stealth skills. 

#### Dodging 
If an opponent hits you with an attack, you may attempt a dodge check. In order to dodge, you must succeed an DC8 dodge roll by at least as much as your attacker succeeded their attack (an opposed check). If you succeed your dodge check, the attack misses you, but you are at a -3 to attacks and fine movements during the next round.

#### Using stealth again 
You can make an opposed stealth check to run away from opponents that you are in melee with, if your GM allows it. Circumstances may not permit using stealth to escape, such as if there is no cover available or if your opponents are able to move significantly faster than you are. The GM is the final arbiter of if this option is available.

#### Taking Damage 
When you are hit by an attack, you may take damage. The amount of damage you take will depend on what type of attack hit you, and what kind of equipment (if any) you are wearing. Some armour in Cinematic absorbs some of the damage for you.<br/> 
<br/>
Damage output is determined by rolling an appropriate number of d6 die, and adding the resulting rolls and any modifiers that apply to the attack. This damage is dealt to the opponent, who then subtracts any armour protection, then reduces their available hit points by the remaining amount. <br/>
<br/>
<b>When your hit points reach zero, you fall unconscious and begin to die.</b><br/>
<br/>
#### Dying
If your character is the victim of too much damage, there is a risk that they will die.

#### Applying Character Statuses 
Some attacks or circumstances may cause a status to be applied to your character. Statuses reflect circumstances that would present you with some sort of advantage or disadvantage.

## Magic 
Magic is a hallmark of the fantasy genera. Regardless of whether you are playing in a low, high, or modern fantasy game, there will most likely be some sort of magic involved. You will have to consult with your game master to find out what type of magic they will be supporting in their game.

### How does magic work? 
This is a loaded question. How your game master chooses to answer it will influence everything about the game. Here, I do not set out to answer all the specifics about magic from a setting perspective, but I do set out to give you the framework of rules within which magic works. 

### Magic is a Talent 
If you are playing a caster, your character will have some sort of talent provided by your GM that gives you magical ability. This can be called a wide variety of things depending on the setting, from simply "magic" to "arcanism” or “divine channelling.” The level of the talent you take will determine how powerful of a spell you can cast, and will influence how many times you can perform certain feats of magic per day. 

### Spells 
Spells are the building block of magic in Cinematic. When you want to do something magical, you cast a spell. Think of a spell as its own self contained microcosm of rules. The game master will give you a list of spells that are available in their world, listed by caster level. You can cast any spell of your talent level or lower. <br/>
<br/>
The rules for each spell dictate when you can cast the spells, along with what the effects are. The spell text is considered the final authority for determining how a spell works. Some spells may contradict the normal rules of the Cinematic game. This is fine, just go with what the spell's text says, and you will be fine.<br/>
<br/>
<center><em>I recommend copying each spell's rule text to a separate index card, and keeping these with your character sheet. This will make casting spells faster and less argument prone, since you will have the rule text with you.</em></center>

### Mana 
The ability to cast a spell depends not only upon you knowing (and being powerful enough) to cast it, but your also having the energy to do so. Mana is a reflection of how much magical energy you have available to you at any given time. <br/>
<br/>
A caster begins each day with mana points equal to his caster talent level multiplied by 10 (e.g. a level 8 arcanist starts the day with 80 mana points). This is called a mana pool. You can cast a spell only when you have enough mana points remaining in your mana pool. <br/>
<br/>
There may be ways provided by your game master to expand and/or recharge your mana pool during the game day, such as magical items or potions. Mana may be referred to by a different name depending on how your GM has styled his world and game, but it will, in essence, work the same.

## Game Mastering 
The game master is the referee of the roleplaying game. The GM decides what happens, who wins in contests, and controls the flow of the game. They also do all the work of planning the story of the game, and designing adventures for the players to embark upon.<br/>
<br/>
People commonly decide to become a game master because they find that they have a story to tell, or because they want to craft an experience for their friends. Others learn to become a game master because nobody else wants to be one, or because they have an experience that they do not want to repeat under another game master!<br/>
<br/>
Whatever your reason for wanting to be a game master, I endeavour to explain the basics that you will need to know about game mastering, along with the rules of Cinematic that apply specifically to the game master, such as world, equipment, skill, talent, and creature creation. 

### Learning To Be a Game Master

### Typical DC's
| Difficulty |   DC |
| :--------- | ---: |
| Easy       |    6 |
| Normal     |    8 |
| Hard       |   10 |
| Very Hard  |   12 |
| Impossible |   14 |

### Talents 
Game masters should take care in designing talents to ensure that they do not augment skills in a way that overpowers the game mechanic. Talents should be reserved for abilities and bonuses that cannot be granted any other way. Talents that increase the amount of damage that a character can do per round (via extra attacks, damage bonuses, etc.) should cost more than normal talents and be subject to level caps. A general guideline is that every extra die of damage should cost at least 3 pts.

### Magic 
Not all fantasy games need magic. Not all sci-fi games should exclude it. Be creative. You should be aware though, that including magic will add a level of difficulty to your job as a GM. Be sure whether you want magic to be available to your characters before you begin your game. You will want to account for the power that your characters will be capable of wielding when you design encounters.<br/>
<br/>
There are several types of magic that Cinematic supports, and you can easily modify them to cover almost any imaginable magic system. At the built in level, Cinematic supports arcane casting, psionics, and alchemy. You can combine these to create game magics that draw inspiration from Tolkien, Sanderson, Rothfuss, etc. (e.g. combining the arcane and alchemical systems to provide a Mystborn style magic to players)<br/>
<br/>
Your gamers do not need to know how you used the spell/ability generation rules to create your magic system. The important part is that your players know exactly how their abilities work, their powers are consistent, and the power of their abilities matches the expectations you have for your game. You do not need a low level character suddenly possessing the ability to destroy a mountain, and your players do not want to learn a bad-ass spell only to find out it is not powerful enough to handle a common bar room thug.

#### The Nitty Gritty 
Cinematic handles magic in a building block fashion behind the scenes. You connect the things you want a spell to do, add up the cost of each piece, and you have the level of the spell. Generating the mechanics of a spell can literally take seconds once you are familiar with the building pieces. Once you have the mechanical portion built, it is up to you as the GM to write a bit about how the spell looks, feels, and how it "works” in your game world. This is the most important part of spell design, since it is the most influential to your games tone.

#### Arcane Magic 
Building an arcane spell is easy.
1. Choose your level of damage. Note the cost for this damage level.
2. Choose the area your damage is applied to. Note the cost for this as well.
3. Select abilities that are attached to the spell. Does it catch the area on fire? Does it make someone move? Does it shoot shards of ice? These things can both add and subtract from the cost of the spell. Note all of these abilities and their costs. 
4. Add the costs and abilities together and describe how the spell works on a card. The total of all added costs is the level of the spell. Only casters with that level talent or above can
cast this spell, and it costs mana equal to its level.<br/> 

<br/>
For an example of how a spell card can look, see the appendix.<br/>
<br/>
Teleportation spells are a little different. These spells are primarily based around how far you are going, whether you have been there before, the ability to carry others, etc. These spells are still built by adding the cost of abilities, but there is no damage or area elements - just distance and ability.<br/>
<br/>

To build a teleportation spell:

1. Decide how far the spell can carry you. Note the cost.
2. Decide what abilities the teleportation has. Can you carry cargo? Passengers? Note the costs.
3. Add the costs, and describe how the spell works on a card.

#### Damage 
All damage is represented by a number of damage dice. You should keep in mind the maximum and minimum amounts of damage that a spell can cause each round in order to keep the game balanced. Average damage dealt will be a mean of the minimum and maximum value.

| Damage Amount | Level Cost |
| :------------ | ---------: |
| 1d6           |         +1 |
| 2d6           |         +2 |
| 3d6           |         +3 |
| 4d6           |         +4 |
| 5d6           |         +5 |
| 6d6           |         +6 |

And so on....

#### Areas 
Area effects have an exponential and potentially profound effect upon gameplay, as the damage inflicted by a spell begins to be applied to more than one creature. To compensate for the extreme nature of area spells, the cost in spell levels grows exponentially as the area does.

##### Blast Areas
| Distance | Level Cost |
| :------- | ---------: |
| 0 sq.    |         +0 |
| 1 sq.    |         +2 |
| 2 sq.    |         +4 |
| 3 sq.    |         +8 |
| 4 sq.    |        +16 |
| 5 sq.    |       + 32 |

Blast areas are calculated as a radius (in squares) from the spell activation point.
